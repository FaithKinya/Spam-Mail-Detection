# Overview
This project is a machine learning model designed to classify emails as spam or not spam (ham) based on their content. The model utilizes a TfidfVectorizer for features etraction to convert text to vectors and machine learning algorithms such as LogisticRegression to detect spam emails effectively.

# Dataset used
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x2KlxQQ5BwbSawFNS13G28OQo2cd908L/view?usp=sharing
The dataset should contain:
- Email text
- Label (spam or ham)

# Future Improvements
- Use NLTK & SpaCy (Natural Language Processing)
- Improve accuracy with deep learning techniques like LSTMs or Transformers.
- Incorporate additional features like email metadata analysis.
